            It&apos;s important to get your audio and video set up correctly now, because it&apos;s much more difficult to fix your videos after you&apos;ve recorded. There are many creative ways to use what you have to create professional looking video.

        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Equipment can be easy</h4>
        <p className='mb-6 max-w-4xl'>
          You don&apos;t need to buy fancy equipment. Most smartphone cameras can capture video in HD, and you can record audio on another phone or external microphone.
        </p>

        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Students need to hear you.</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>A good microphone is the most important piece of equipment you will choose. There are lot of affordable options.. Make sure it&apos;s correctly plugged in and 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) from you.
        </p>

        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Make a studio.</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>Clean up your background and arrange props. Almost any small space can be transformed with a backdrop made of colored paper or an ironed bed sheet.</p>

        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Light the scene and your face</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>Turn off overhead lights. Experiment with three point lighting by placing two lamps in front of you and one behind aimed on the background.</p>

        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Reduce noise and echo</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>Turn off fans or air vents, and record at a time when it&apos;s quiet. Place acoustic foam or blankets on the walls, and bring in rugs or furniture to dampen echo.</p>


        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Be creative.</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>Students won&apos;t see behind the scenes. No one will know if you&apos;re surrounded by pillows for soundproofing...unless you tell other instructors in the community!
        </p>
