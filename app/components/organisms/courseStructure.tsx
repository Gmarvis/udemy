      <h4 className="font-bold mb-3">Start with your goals</h4>
      <p className="mb-6 max-w-4xl">
        Setting goals for what learners will accomplish in your course (also known as  <a href="/#" className="underline decoration-purple text-purple">learning objectives</a>) at the beginning will help you determine what content to include in your course and how you will teach the content to help your learners achieve the goals.
      </p>

      <h4 className="font-bold mb-3">Create an outline.</h4>
      <p className="mb-6">Setting goals for what learners will accomplish in your course (also known as<a href="/#" className="underline decoration-purple text-purple">learning objectives</a>) at the beginning will help you determine what content to include in your course and how you will teach the content to help your learners achieve the goals.
      </p>

      <h4 className="font-bold mb-3">Introduce yourself and create momentum.</h4>
      <p className="mb-6">People online want to start learning quickly. Make an introduction section that gives learners something to be excited about in the first 10 minutes.</p>

      <h4 className="font-bold mb-3">Sections have a clear learning objective.</h4>
      <p className="mb-6">Introduce each section by describing the section&apos;s <a href="/#" className="underline decoration-purple text-purple">goal and why it&apos;s important.</a> Give lectures and sections titles that reflect their content and have a logical flow.</p>

      <h4 className="font-bold mb-3">Lectures cover one concept.</h4>
      <p className="mb-6">A good lecture length is 2-7 minutes to keep students interested and help them study in short bursts. Cover a single topic in each lecture so learners can easily find and re-watch them later.</p>


      <h4 className="font-bold mb-3">Mix and match your lecture types.</h4>
      <p className="mb-6">Alternate between filming yourself, your screen, and slides or other visuals. Showing yourself can help learners feel connected.
      </p>

      <h4 className="font-bold mb-3">Practice activities create hands-on learning.</h4>
      <p className="mb-6">Help learners <a href="/#" className="underline decoration-purple text-purple">apply your lessons</a> to their real world with projects, assignments, coding exercises, or worksheets.</p>
