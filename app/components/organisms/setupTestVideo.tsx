        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Equipment can be easy</h4>
        <p className='mb-6 max-w-4xl'>
        You don't need to buy fancy equipment. Most smartphone cameras can capture video in HD, and you can record audio on another phone or external microphone.
        </p>

        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Students need to hear you.</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>A good microphone is the most important piece of equipment you will choose. There are lot of affordable options.. Make sure it's correctly plugged in and 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) from you.
        </p>

        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Make a studio.</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>Clean up your background and arrange props. Almost any small space can be transformed with a backdrop made of colored paper or an ironed bed sheet.</p>

        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Light the scene and your face</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>Turn off overhead lights. Experiment with three point lighting by placing two lamps in front of you and one behind aimed on the background.</p>

        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Lectures cover one concept.</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>A good lecture length is 2-7 minutes to keep students interested and help them study in short bursts. Cover a single topic in each lecture so learners can easily find and re-watch them later.</p>


        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Mix and match your lecture types.</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>Alternate between filming yourself, your screen, and slides or other visuals. Showing yourself can help learners feel connected.
        </p>

        <h4 className='font-bold mb-3'>Practice activities create hands-on learning.</h4>
        <p className='mb-6'>Help learners <a href="/#" className="underline decoration-blue-500 text-blue-700">apply your lessons</a> to their real world with projects, assignments, coding exercises, or worksheets.</p>
